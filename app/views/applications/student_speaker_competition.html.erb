        <h1>Student Speaker Competition 2014</h1>
        <p>TEDxYale 2014 will be held on March 29th, and we want to select a group of students to join our growing speaker list. In past years, our student speakers have given some of the most convincing and moving talks, so we're looking for people with a story to tell. If you'd like to audition, or think you know someone who should, let us know below.</p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>The competition is made up of two rounds. The first round is for anyone who wants to participate and involves a 3 minute summary of your TED talk. These auditions are done in front of the TEDxYale team. For the second round, our team selects the 8-10 best talks from the first round, and those students perform again for our team, after expanding their talk to approximately 5 minutes and adding slides if appropriate. The final round is filmed, and we will be uploading the talks to our website for voting.</p>
    <p>The application process will end on November 17th, and our first round will be held on Tuesday, November 19th.</p>
