    <p>Thanks for registering for the TEDxYale Student Speaker Competition! We are very excited about the competition and can't wait to hear your talk. You should know that you will be given a 10 minute time slot in the evening of Tuesday, November 27th to present for the first round. Your presentation should be no more than 3 minutes long, however, and it should be an accurate summary of what your 10 minute TED talk in February would be.</p>
